# 🧠 45-Day LeetCode OA Prep (Jane Street + BlackRock Focus)

## 🎯 Goal
Master online assessments for **Jane Street INSIGHT** and **BlackRock 2026 internships**. Focused on:
- Clean Python implementation
- Parsing-heavy problems
- DSA fundamentals and advanced logic
- Mock OA readiness

---

## 🗓️ Timeline
- **Day 1–12**: Parsing, arrays, strings, logic (Jane Street-friendly)
- **Day 13–25**: Core DSA (stacks, trees, greedy, etc.)
- **Day 26–45**: DP, graphs, full mocks & edge case mastery

---

## ⏱️ Daily Commitment
| Phase           | Time/Day       | Focus                                              |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Days 1–12       | 3.5–5 hrs/day   | Core problems + parsing/simulation drills          |
| Mock Days       | 2–2.5 hrs       | Full timed OA + review                             |
| Days 13–45      | 3–4.5 hrs/day   | Deep DSA + pattern drilling + review/mocks         |

### 🔍 Parsing Days Breakdown
- **Day 1**: Split integers from space-separated input
- **Day 3**: Frequency map, malformed text
- **Day 7**: Stack-based command simulation
- **Day 9**: Multi-line I/O (e.g., `Read4`)
- **Day 10**: Reverse Polish eval, object simulation
- **Day 12**: CSV/JSON-like parser/tokenizer (mini project)
